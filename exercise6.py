# Create a dictionary of information about each language and include the main country (or countries) that the language is
#spoken in, its approximate number of speakers, and one fact about that language. The keys for each
#languageâ€™s dictionary should be something like location, speakers, and fact.

#2. Python Crash Course, Chapter 7, Exercise 7-10 (p. 131)
#Write a program that polls users about their dream vacation. Write a prompt similar to If you could visit one
#place in the world, where would you go? Include a block of code that prints the results of the poll.

#3. Write a program	that reads some text files found in Project Gutenberg, and count how many times the word "the" appears in them.

#I found a text file of "Astounding Stories," delightful pulp sci-fi from the 1930s.
